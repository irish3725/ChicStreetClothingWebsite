                        <h2>Jonathan Chen</h2>
                        <p>Born in the quaint village of Havana, Afghanistan, Jonathan
                     made his way to success via very conventional and unconventional means. He never ate salamanders, but he did, indeed, frog jump his way to success. He met Alexander on the 32nd of August in the year 2017. It was Jon's idea to start a clothing company, not Alex's. However, he was backstabbed on the 33rd of August, and he now lies in a ditch near Tokyo. However, his legacy will be carried on for years to come through Chic Street Style.</p>

                        <h2>Alexander Irish</h2>
                        <p>Alexander was born in a small town in Montana called Lewistown. He spent the first 18 years of his life in a car stuck behind some old person driving 10 miles per hour in town on a two lane street where they could not be passed. Some years later, while shopping at a Macy's for some clothes for his significan other, he ran into Jonathan. After a short conversation about how expensive the clothes were, they decided to start Chic Street Style. Alexander is doing very well for himself now.</p>
